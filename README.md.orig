*EventPointer* is a software to identify alternative splicing events in complex experimental designs such as time course and paired samples studies. The algorithm can be used to analyze data from either junction arrays (Affymetrix Arrays) or sequencing data (RNA-Seq). The software retrieves a data.frame with the detected alternative splicing events: gene name, type of event (cassette, alternative 3',...,etc), genomic position, statistical significance and percent spliced in (Delta PSI) for all the events. The algorithm can generate a series of files to visualize the detected alternative splicing events in IGV. This eases the interpretation of results and the design of primers for standard PCR validation.
